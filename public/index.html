                <p> Humanity must rapidly and sharply discontinue use of the fossil fuels that power over 80% of the
                    global
                    economy, lest we precipitate radical climate disruption. In light of the urgency and depth of
                    climate-stabilizing decarbonization, this cannot be achieved only (or even mainly) with <em
                        class="text-serif"> low-carbon energy </em> from new technology (i.e. “new and improved”
                    manipulation of matter): only <em class="text-serif">low-energy societies</em> will. These have long
                    supported human life successfully, including the economic surpluses that sustained refined
                    civilizations. Now the new technological capabilities wrought by modern civilization allow us to
                    contemplate the good life for all in similarly low-energy societies —as long as we redress the
                    dispossessing inequalities that marked it from the beginning, and which are eminently correctible.
                </p>
                <p> Because energy is central to all social organization, decarbonized societies spell a different
                    world: a
                    “transition,” of historic proportions, into a new social and economic order, indeed into new
                    societies
                    that green the economy as well as the Earth’s surface. A transition from one social system to
                    another is
                    what’s known as “system change.” This has already begun. The breakdown of social order unfolding in
                    multiple dimensions —even before modern society’s ecological impact starts to dislocate life— is its
                    first stage: chaos precedes new order. We are living in the interregnum of social and conceptual
                    disarray that happens when an old world has not finished dying and the new one is not yet born. The
                    sooner we clarify the contours of another future, the sooner we’ll be able to start restoring order.
                </p>
                <p> A “new system,” indeed, must be “designed” (or to be more precise midwifed), for the simple reason
                    that
                    no social order has ever existed that was not first prefigured. The threat of radical climate
                    disruption
                    places us before an unprecedented challenge, that will only be met with unprecedented —i.e. novel
                    and
                    unfamiliar— organizing principles and policy responses. This is why our usual political and economic
                    lenses are ill-suited both to detect the roots of spreading dysfunctions and to clarify the
                    structure of
                    their redress …most notably our Right vs Left, or now Globalist vs Nationalist readings of social
                    organization. A “green” reading of sustainability spells what standard ideological categories would
                    describe as a “Radical Center” “Glocalism,” that reconciles these complementary concerns and
                    dissolves
                    their ensuing conflicts. For it has become clear that modern industrial civilization is not only
                    ecologically unsustainable, but also socio-economically dispossessing, paralyzingly
                    overbureaucratized,
                    and, ultimately, existentially impoverishing. Another world has been in the making for decades, in
                    pioneering niches of academia (most notably ecological economics), sprouts of political activism and
                    unwitting reshapings of culture. It will only come into existence if and when a new organizing
                    utopia is
                    sufficiently mature to clarify its policy contours. </p>
                <p> The accumulation of transformative power made possible by industrialization has come with an
                    unforeseen
                    consequence: ecological footprint. Its expanding impact has now brought us to what amounts to a new
                    geological epoch, the Anthropocene, in which humanity no longer just <em
                        class="text-serif">inhabits</em>, but is in charge of her habitat. The very shape of the planet
                    is
                    now in our hands, which we will henceforth sculpt one way or another, whether by destroying it or by
                    transforming it into a garden where all life can flourish. OIKOS is vowed to incubate, clarify and
                    promote the organizational hinges of a carbon-constrained world, i.e. the ideas, concepts and
                    “policy
                    frameworks” capable of spurring and coordinating a rapid, drastic and harmonious decarbonization.
                    These
                    “institutional algorithms” are embodied in novel (i.e. unconventional and thus unfamiliar)
                    organizing
                    concepts, which not only define several immediately applicable policy proposals; but also give us a
                    glimpse of what can only be concisely described as a green civilization. </p>

        <!-- HISTORICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT -->
        <article>
            <h1 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse__historial-context">HISTORICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT</h1>
            <div id="collapse__historial-context" class="collapse">
                <p> The economic, political and social breakdown and chaos that have already begun to unfold in slow
                    historical motion have clouded the future with unprecedented threats and uncertainty. As ecological,
                    technological and economic dystopias emerge on the horizon, yesterday’s dreams of economic and
                    technological progress turn into nightmares. This has no less than historical implications, for it
                    signals the exhaustion of modern civilization’s key organizing utopia and first universally shared
                    belief: “progress” and “development.” But these now promise no less than universal disaster. </p>
                <p> The future is not something that will happen to us. The shape of the future will depend on the shape
                    of
                    today’s policies and institutions, much like the present is the outcome of past policies and
                    institutions. Today’s political leaders and policymakers are proving unable to redress unfolding
                    dysfunctions, let alone to avert emerging novel threats, because they keep pursuing the organizing
                    goals
                    of a crumbling historical system: the fossil-fuel-powered industrial civilization that emerged from
                    the
                    European Enlightenment, that brought both the breathtaking marvels that have provided a thousand
                    boons,
                    but also the dispossessing inequalities and destitution that few if any governments have managed to
                    redress. Geopolitical competition, national “economic” (i.e. GDP) growth and technological
                    development
                    are not only unable to redress distributional and ecological dysfunctions: they are at their very
                    root.
                    A different future can —and by now must— be outlined to guide thought and action. The good news is
                    that
                    it has been in the making for decades. The bad news is that it has not yet crystallized in a new
                    organizing image. We have entered the interregnum of chaos, as Gramsci famously put it, that emerges
                    between the demise of an old system that has not finished dying and a new one that is not yet born.
                </p>
                <p> We will only weather unfolding multidimensional storms if we have a clear enough idea of the
                    direction
                    of a safe port, and a new helm for a ship that is by now unequipped to navigate unprecedented
                    whirlwinds. </p>
                <p> Humanity’s direction has long been Progress, i.e. technological and economic “development” (since
                    there
                    is no common understanding of what “social” progress can mean other than the decline of violence).
                    Progress has been no less than humanity’s first shared belief. For the first time in history,
                    virtually
                    all peoples aligned their action along pursuit of the same goal —the “wealth of nations”— when they
                    adopted GDP growth as their organizing norm, spawning the first truly global civilization, that
                    interconnected all peoples. The problem is that technological and economic progress now lead to
                    dystopia. All attempts to make it ecologically sustainable and socially generalizable have failed.
                </p>
                <p> Once the problem becomes apparent, however, so does the “solution.” Progress is intrinsically
                    disharmonious, both ecologically and socially. So humanity’s shared and organizing belief needs to
                    be
                    abandoned. This implies neither a return to past conditions (i.e. regress) nor “advance” toward a
                    new or
                    better understanding or dimension of progress, both of which remain conceptually framed by the same
                    view
                    of the “arrow of history.” Unlike Progress, however, Harmony is not an endless process (i.e.
                    deprived
                    both of purpose other than the development of means, and of a termination): it is a state of social
                    organization. History has not been driven by “progress,” which was only the organizing belief and
                    norm
                    of modern societies. Progress was only the latest (and most systematic) expression of an altogether
                    different process: the unification of humankind, as historian Yuval Harari, e.g., has glimpsed. The
                    “arrow of history” does not fly indefinitely: arrows land on a target: a <em
                        class="text-serif">telos</em>. </p>
                <p> Once a new destination becomes clear, so does the new path. And so does the new helm that can take
                    us to
                    safe port: new coordinating institutions. For these are what aligns and harmonizes dispersed human
                    action: “form follows function”: meaningful purpose highlights the measurable goals, that define the
                    strategies, that outline the structure of social organization. </p>
                <p> Although conventional readings of social organization do not yet have a clue of just how, low-energy
                    economies could ensure the good life for all. A rapid, drastic and harmonious decarbonization is
                    indeed
                    possible: proper (if novel) fiscal and regulatory management of fossil fuel energy distribution and
                    use
                    can spur and coordinate the widespread adoption of <em class="text-serif">low-, zero- and
                        negative-carbon</em> goods, technologies, production methods and ways, and open far more
                    fulfilling
                    livelihoods with less “consumption.” From the perspective of existing realities, however, the
                    exciting
                    possibilities opened by a societal shift remain far from obvious. Before they are outlined, they
                    cannot
                    come to be. </p>
                <p> What can foster the good life for all are not new technologies and GDP growth, that have driven the
                    construction of modern civilization. Succinctly put, the hinges of societies’ welfare are new
                    institutions and policy that simultaneously consolidate <em class="text-serif">1)</em> ecological,
                    <em class="text-serif">2)</em> (re)distributional and <em class="text-serif">3)</em> market
                    equilibria.
                    This would translate into growth of some technologies, goods and countries, and the degrowth of
                    others
                    —but in all cases, in a quantum leap in human welfare resulting from the qualitative reorganization.
                </p>
                <p> Culture boils down to stories and accounts. Just like (indefinite) Progress was measured by
                    (indefinite)
                    GDP growth, Harmony is embodied in the triple equilibrium. This <em class="text-serif">1)</em>

            <div id="collapse__dynamics-system-change" class="collapse pl2em">
                <p> All fundamental innovation begins as a crazy idea, for the simple reason that it is unprecedented by
                    definition, and therefore radically unfamiliar: it is an affront to “common” (i.e. shared) sense
                    because
                    it runs counter to the conventional wisdom. So the validity of a new concept in social organization
                    does
                    not depend on its immediate but on its potential social acceptability: whether it is grounded on
                    self-evidently fair principles that can be widely and durably embraced, so as to ensure their
                    coordination function. A real social novum, after all, always begins way “ahead of the (adoption)
                    curve,” i.e. before it goes through specific phases that are well-understood by now: disregard,
                    scepticism, opposition and embrace (i.e. in Mahatma Gandhi’s famous formulation, “first they ignore
                    you,
                    then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win”). </p>
                <p> Its validity, however, also depends on its internal coherence. The communist project, e.g., didn’t
                    last
                    because it didn’t leave enough room for individual preferences and initiative. Similarly, a “green
                    new
                    deal” (at least the specific projects born by the slogan) would not avert radical climate
                    disruption,
                    even if it had unanimous support. If coherence is missing —as is the case in most inventions— the
                    novelty is stillborn. </p>
                <p> Every social novum, however, is preceded by precursors. These are fated to fail, but indispensable
                    to
                    lay the groundwork for the unprecedented way of doing things because at first they seek to reform,
                    not
                    replace an outdated conceptual framework. Despite Professor Harari’s glimpse into the nature of the
                    arrow of history, e.g., he remains squarely framed by modernity’s technological narrative.
                    “Sustainable
                    development” has similarly come to mean sustainable techno-economic accumulation measured by GDP
                    growth
                    —so small wonder that since the concept emerged in the late 1980s, we keep uploading GHGs into the
                    atmosphere. </p>
                <p> “System change” goes through similar stages and follows a similar dynamic to the advent of any
                    novelty.
                    The pace of both system <em class="text-serif">collapse</em> and system <em
                        class="text-serif">emergence</em> (whether partial or comprehensive) is similar to the way in
                    which
                    ruin befell Ernest Hemingway‘s character, who was asked how he went bankrupt: “First slowly, then
                    suddenly.” </p>
                <p> To see how fast and unexpectedly (partial or complete) system change can happen, we can look at the
                    two
                    revolutions that inaugurated the political structure of modern civilization. As late as February
                    1776,
                    if I remember well, George Washington was not battling “British,” let alone “foreign” troops, but
                    “metropolitan” troops: independence was not (yet) in the offing: he sought a reform of the colonial
                    order. The French Revolution was even more astonishing. An “Estates General” had been convened in
                    May
                    1789 to address the Kingdom’s trying woes. The list of grievances and the political agenda boiled
                    down
                    to largely fiscal questions. Hardly any Enlightenment voices were to be heard: everyone was a
                    monarchist. But few weeks later, the world would witness one of the most consequential political
                    earthquakes in history. </p>
                <p> In both cases, what triggered the revolutionary shift was a political pamphlet: Thomas Paine’s
                    Common
                    Sense in the USA, and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès’s <em class="text-serif">What is the Third Estate?</em>
                    In
                    effect, both postulated what amounted to new institutions that inaugurated a novel historical order.
                    In
                    Paine’s case, it was explicit. But Sieyès’s “game changer” is more instructive because it was
                    implicit.
                    For he proposed a minor change in the Estates General. The country’s institutional pillars at the
                    time
                    were the three Estates —the aristocracy, the clergy and the people— that had one vote each in the
                    convention. Sieyès proposed instead a one-man-one-vote system. This may now seem like a rather
                    obvious
                    and straightforward democratic principle. But it was a totally novel, clearly circumscribed and
                    merely
                    procedural modification that was so reasonable that the king himself OK’ed it —and thereby set in
                    motion
                    a chain of events that led to the Revolution. </p>

                <p> Social change, in short, can come unexpectedly fast when a new coordinating principle emerges to
                    address
                    the issue of the day. Even better news comes from another remarkable feature of fundamental
                    discovery:
                    once a problem has been properly diagnosed, and thus its remedy implicitly clarified, putting it to
                    use
                    is relatively straightforward. The story of Columbus’s egg illustrates this especially promising
                    property of paradigm shifts. After he came back from the new world, a noble is said to have
                    belittled
                    his discovery, by pointing out that there was really nothing to sailing across the ocean, that
                    anybody
                    could do it. Columbus asked him whether he could stand an egg on its vertical axis on a flat table
                    without any prop. After the noble proclaimed this to be impossible, Columbus took an egg and cracked
                    it
                    slightly so it would stand on the table. Now that he knew how to do it, it was indeed easy, wasn’t
                    it?
                    The really hard part, in other words, was to get to the “Indies” and come back (if not what actually
                    absorbed most of his effort: raising the money for a trip west when everybody knew that the Earth
                    was
                    flat). A paradigm change is a change in the conventional wisdom. And when it implies high-impact
                    social
                    innovation, it is usually as costly to develop, or arduous to come by, as it is simple to formulate,
                    and
                    easy to transmit and use, once it has been discovered or recognized. </p>

            <div id="collapse__focus-goals" class="collapse">
                <p> An arresting realization is slowly dawning on industrial modernity. Technological ingenuity alone
                    (“new
                    and improved” manipulation of matter) cannot ensure the speed and depth of the decarbonization
                    required
                    to stabilize the climate on time to avoid reaching the tipping points feared to precipitate
                    “runaway”
                    global warming. For in order to preserve the possibility of a livable future, we need to
                    discontinue, in
                    one generation, the greenhouse gases emitted by the fossil fuels that drive some 85% of the global
                    economy. This lays bare the magnitude of the challenge to which history now <a href="#;">summons</a>
                    humanity. The popular slogan had been calling it for years: “<em class="text-serif">change the
                        system,
                        not the climate.</em>” Now the UN Environment Program <em class="text-serif">confirms</em> it,
                    “With
                    no credible pathway to 1.5°C in place,” we are set for climate disaster, that “<em
                        class="text-serif">
                        only an urgent system-wide transformation can avoid. </em>” </p>
                <p> Social innovation happens at four levels of social organization, that institutional economics has by
                    now
                    clarified: <em class="text-serif">1)</em> the technologies and methods of everyday production and
                    organization (the “hardware”), <em class="text-serif">2)</em> the policies that coordinate them (the
                    “software”), <em class="text-serif">3)</em> the fundamental institutions that frame policy (the
                    “operating system”), and <em class="text-serif">4)</em> the beliefs, stories and habits that
                    underpin
                    them (aka “humanware”). Change at any one level affects all others. But the most decisive levers of
                    “system change” are institutions: the “<a href="#;">organizational algorithms</a>” that channel and
                    coordinate collective and individual action. </p>
                <p> Venture capital runs on the logic of “low-probability/ high-impact” ideas: money poured into most
                    embryonic new concepts will go to waste, but it only takes one of them to work for the investment to
                    pay
                    off handsomely. This laboratory of decarbonization alternatives runs on the same principle of
                    regular
                    venture capital pools, but differs from them in one key respect: it is vowed to social innovation
                    —embodied in novel “institutional algorithms,” policy concepts and politics—, rather than commercial
                    innovation, whose goods and services can be sold in the market. </p>
                <p>In the words of Milton Friedman, we face<br> <em class="color-rojo text-serif"> “enormous inertia
                        [and]
                        tyranny of the status quo […]. Only a crisis —actual or perceived— produces real change. When
                        that
                        crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I
                        believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive
                        and
                        available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.”</em><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p> A simple reading of the costs and benefits of knowledge highlights the comparative superiority of
                    normative social (over technological) RDDD&D. In the words of three Nobel Memorial laureates: <br>
                    <em class="color-rojo text-serif"> “as compared with technological innovation, the study of
                        organizational innovation has been neglected, [even though] “truly among man’s innovations, the
                        use
                        of organization to accomplish his ends is among both his greatest and his earliest”
                    </em>(Kenneth
                    Arrow<sup>2</sup>, quoted by Oliver Williamson<sup>3</sup>).
                </p>
                <p> Indeed, by virtue of its coordination capacity, the decarbonizing impact of institutional innovation
                    should dwarf that of material technologies —for a far lower cost: <br> <em
                        class="color-rojo text-serif"> “Next to the most sumptuous scientific tool of physics, the
                        Superconducting Super Collider, whose construction cost is estimated to be on the order of $10
                        bn,
                        the experiments of economics look excessively frugal” </em>(Gérard Debreu<sup>3</sup>).</p>
                <p> Investment in instruments or “algorithms” of social coordination, in short, can be expected to dwarf
                    the
                    costs and impacts involved in the manipulation of matter (and indeed to spur its development).
                    System
                    change has long been considered to be politically inconceivable. But the threat of radical climate
                    disruption has turned it into an unavoidable condition of collective survival.</p>
