        <p>Historical “system change” has begun: economic, political and cultural turbulence spreading in slow historical
            motion and in unexpected jolts suggest that we have entered the interregnum of multifarious disarray that
            typically ensues, as Antonio Gramsci famously put it, when an old order is dying and the new cannot be born.
            Never mind the technological and ecological dystopias that the old order is spawning, and whose implications
            have so far been only barely detected by our habitual economic, political and cultural radars.</p>
        <p>So we are drifting into a future that has become completely blurred, if not threatening. That’s because the
            shared worldview and beliefs that long oriented social thought and organization are breaking down, especially in
            the countries that were once at the core of the world system. Hence the spuriousness, vacuity or vanity of
            politics —or, e.g., the spread of “cancel culture”: when the narratives that sustain a social order collapse,
            when standard formulae become ineffective, censorship and repression become increasingly necessary to maintain
            an exhausted <em>status quo</em>.</p>
        <p>And so the drift continues. The unfolding of disarray will only come to an end when new institutions that embody
            a new order coordinate dispersed social action in a new direction. A new historical order has not been born
            because so far it has been gestating. For the moment, we only know that it will be, well, green. But what
            follows energy-intensive and fossil-fuel-powered industrial civilization comes into focus from a new reading of
            the world that highlights a clear enough sense of purpose that ushers in a new shared vision of the future.</p>
        <p>The future is not something that will “happen” to us or to our children: it will be shaped by the (national and
            global) policies and norms that will be in force over the next few years. The future, in other words, will only
            become again clear when we realize that it’s up to us to define it. It becomes apparent from clear-eyed
            responses to unfolding dysfunctions and foreseeable threats. And the sooner we discern the contours of the next
            historical system to emerge beyond our interregnum of disarray, the sooner the recomposition of life can begin.
            For that’s what will spawn the social narratives, political strategies and economic tools of a new social order.
        </p>
        <p>Now the first feature of any social order is peace —among nations, political factions and everyday life. It has
            long been widely acknowledged in informed circles that climate stability is a condition of long-term peace. But
            the wars that keep erupting make it obvious that peace in the short-term is itself a precondition of a global
            (and thus concerted) drive to decarbonization that is rapid and decisive enough to keep the accumulation of
            atmospheric GHG from radically dislocating the climate system. World peace and climate stability, in other
            words, are inseparable: both are key pillars of a new historical paradigm that brings multidimensional security
            for all. A livable habitat can only come with world peace, for both involve historical system change.</p>
        <p>In order to do their job effectively, journalists, academics, political activists and actors, and even
            policymakers, need to understand not only the basics of climate science but also of the politics and economics
            of climate-stabilizing system change. And that requires making reliable knowledge accessible —education—, and
            highlighting the contours of a new historical paradigm —the terms, topics and talking points for competent
            professional activism.</p>
