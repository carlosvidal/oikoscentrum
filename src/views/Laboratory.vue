            <span class="text-nowrap">José Ortega y Gasset</span>
        </p>


        <p>The old activist slogan <em>“change the system, not the climate”</em> is now being explicitly <a
                href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022#:~:text=Only%20an%20urgent%20system%2Dwide%20transformation%20can%20avoid%20climate%20disaster"
                target="_blank">urged</a>
            by the United Nations
            Environment Program: for to this day there is <em>
                “no credible pathway to 1.5°C in place. Only an urgent system-wide
                transformation can avoid climate disaster.”
            </em> This will not be achieved with new technologies, however relevant
            these may be: it can only come from social innovation. Structurally unprecedented challenges can only be met
            with unprecedented strategic responses, which are embodied in novel institutions and policies —call them new
            “legal technology”—, that can turn out to be surprisingly easy to adopt and even operationalize once they are
            sufficiently clarified, and which can powerfully orient and equip a new trans-partisan politics. </p>

        <p>We are in a moment, as Milton Friedman once put it, in which we face the <em>
                <a href="#footnote1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">
                    “enormous inertia [and] tyranny of the status quo […]. Only a crisis —actual or perceived— produces real
                    change.
                    When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I
                    believe,
                    is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available
                    until
                    the
                    politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.”
                </a>
            </em></p>
        <p>A simple reading of the costs and benefits of knowledge highlights the comparative superiority of normative
            social (over technological) RDDD&D. In the words of three other Nobel Memorial laureates: <em>
                “as compared with technological innovation, the study of organizational innovation has been neglected, [even
                though] “truly among man’s innovations, the use of organization to accomplish his ends is among both his
                greatest and his earliest”
            </em> (<a href="#footnote2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Kenneth Arrow</a>, quoted by <a
                href="#footnote3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Oliver Williamson</a>).
        </p>
        <p>Translation: by virtue of its coordination capacity, the decarbonizing impact of institutional innovation should
            dwarf that of material technologies —for a far lower cost: <em>
                “Next to the most sumptuous scientific tool of physics, the Superconducting Super Collider, whose
                construction
                cost is estimated to be on the order of $10 bn, the experiments of economics look excessively frugal”
            </em> (<a href="#footnote4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">Gérard Debreu</a>).</p>
        <p>It should be clear that a future we can believe in will not come from technological innovation, but will be
            midwifed by social innovation. <a href="#;" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more1">[ More + ]</a></p>
        <div id="more1" class="collapse">

            <p>System collapse, like system emergence, can happen, as Hemingway once put it, first slowly, then suddenly. A
                new
                social order often comes in increments that change the status quo progressively ...until we finally find
                ourselves in a new normal (the emergence of the internet, e.g.). Other times, it is more sudden (e.g.
                smartphones). The “black swans” that Nassim Taleb brought into view are the unforeseen shocks that hit a
                social
                system and suddenly change everything —but we later rationalize them and incorporate into our view of things
                …forgetting how surprising they were. The fall of the Berlin Wall and of the USSR, e.g., 9/11, the 2008
                financial crisis, Brexit, Donald Trump’s election, were all unexpected jolts. They had been hatching below
                our
                radars.</p>
            <p>But not only systemic breakdowns are unforeseen: so is the irruption of new order. The American and French
                Revolutions, e.g. As late as February 1776, George Washington was not battling “British,” let alone
                “foreign”
                troops, but “metropolitan” troops: the war’s goal was not (yet) independence: he was not seeking a
                revolution,
                only <em>reforms</em> of colonial laws. The French Revolution was even more astonishing. An “Estates
                General” had
                been
                convened in May 1789 to address the Kingdom’s trying woes. The list of grievances and the political agenda
                boiled down to largely fiscal questions. Hardly any Enlightenment voices were to be heard: everyone was a
                monarchist. But a few weeks later, the world would witness one of the most consequential political
                earthquakes
                in history.</p>
            <p>In both cases, what triggered the revolutionary shift was a political pamphlet: Thomas Paine’s <em>Common
                    Sense</em>
                in
                the USA, and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès <em>What is the Third Estate?</em> And in both cases, they postulated
                what
                amounted
                to radically novel institutions that inaugurated a new historical order. In Paine’s case, it was explicit.
                But
                Sieyès’s “game changer” is more instructive because it was implicit. For he proposed a minor change in the
                Estates General: a one-man-one-vote system to replace the system of one vote each for the three Estates —the
                aristocracy, the clergy and the people— that constituted the country’s institutional pillars at the time.
                This
                was but a clearly circumscribed and merely procedural modification. But the ramifications of the new
                decision
                method, that now seems straightforward enough, were far from obvious at the time: it was the formal
                expression
                of democracy: a state that didn’t rest on the three estates, but was accountable to, and shaped by, the
                people.
            </p>
            <p>Fundamental social change, in short, can come unexpectedly fast when a new coordinating principle emerges to
                address the issue of the day. Even better news comes from another remarkable feature of fundamental
                discovery:
                once a problem has been properly diagnosed, and thus its remedy implicitly clarified, putting it to use is
                relatively straightforward and rapid. The story of Columbus’s egg illustrates this especially promising
                property
                of paradigm shifts. After he came back from the new world, a noble is said to have belittled his discovery,
                by
                pointing out that there was really nothing to sailing across the ocean, that anybody could do it. Columbus
                asked
                him whether he could stand an egg on its vertical axis on a flat table without any prop. After the noble
                proclaimed this to be impossible, Columbus took an egg and cracked it slightly so it would stand on the
                table.
                Now that he knew how to do it, it was indeed easy, wasn’t it? The really hard part, in other words, was to
                get
                to the “Indies” and come back (if not what actually absorbed most of his effort: raising the money for a
                trip
                west when everybody knew that the Earth was flat): a game-changing novelty or a fundamental discovery is
                usually
                as costly to develop, or arduous to come by, as it is simple to formulate, and easy to transmit and use once
                it
                has been discovered or recognized. <a href="#;" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more1">[ Less - ]</a>
