                What is new is not the magnitude, not even the quality, but the very essence of the coming rupture in
                consciousness. This rupture is not a break in the line of progress to a new stage; it is not even the
                passage
                from one dimension to another. We can only describe it as a catastrophic break with industrial humanity’s
                image
                of itself.

        <p>The prospect of radical climate disruption changes our very understanding of economics, politics, geopolitics and
            even of history. For it now turns out that industrial society was only possible with the fossil fuels that
            provide over 80% of the world’s energy, most of which needs to be rapidly discontinued lest we precipitate
            catastrophes of biblical proportions. This pulverizes no less than humanity’s first universally shared and
            coordinating belief: our view of history as <em>progress</em> (toward the commodity-intensive
            economies and ways
            of life
            of what were hitherto regarded as “advanced” societies). So the unprecedented existential threat spells not only
            the need for a short-term decarbonization plan, but also a traumatic shift in human consciousness that will take
            at least a generation to play out. For the end of industrial civilization means the end of the worldview and
            beliefs that underpinned it —i.e. the collapse of key pillars of our social consensuses and even of our
            psychological stability. These will be reconstituted as the adjustment to a new predicament elicits a new
            consciousness: a new awareness, worldview and beliefs that will naturally redefine not only the grand strategies
            of social organization but also our modes of relating to nature and to each other.</p>
        <p>For yes, we stand at a <u>momentous</u> point in history. <a href="#;" data-toggle="collapse"

        <div id="more" class="collapse">
            <p>The multidimensional or “poly-crisis” unfolding in what was long the core of the world system signals the
                breakdown of a historical order, whose depth and implications we have barely gauged. Its most telling but
                least
                understood manifestation is the internal corruption and geopolitical decline of the United States, and the
                incipient emergence of the “multipolar” world that is being confusedly anticipated after the USA’s “unipolar
                moment” —the three decades during which it became the only unchallenged global empire in history. For the
                historical wane of no less than the inaugurator and protagonist of modern civilization evinces the
                exhaustion,
                woes and limits of the culture, politics and economics that have informed social order for centuries and by
                now
                throughout the planet.</p>
            <p>Even if we totally ignore industrial society’s ecological impact, e.g., we face a systemic disconnect between
                the
                real economy and its symbolic representation. As a US economist reminded us in 1996, <em>
                    “Most Americans …
                    remember
                    the 1950s and 1960s, when one parent alone could earn enough to afford a car, a house, healthcare
                    insurance,
                    and
                    college tuition, and still save about 8% of income for the future. Now, two earning parents are unable
                    to
                    provide, without going into debt, what one was able to afford just forty years ago.”
                </em> But since per capita
                GDP
                rose from ~$19K in 1960, to ~$40k in 1996, to ~$60k in 2019 (in constant 2010$), economists and politicians,
                journalists and academics, and more generally the public they informed, kept imagining that they were
                getting,
                well, richer. So this has been forcing a revision of GDP, the long-presumed indicator of progress, whose
                growth
                has been the organizing goal of virtually all societies: the common norm and “social grand strategy” that
                coordinated the construction of the first fully globalized civilization in history.</p>
            <p>But we now discover that its impact is threatening our habitat. What we had long taken for granted, suddenly
                becomes a game-changing concern. For bringing our ecological footprint within the limits of the planetary
                boundaries of ecological integrity —beginning with our carbon footprint— means that industrial society can
                neither be perpetuated in so-called “developed” societies, nor replicated in “developing” societies. And
                what
                might be thought of as the “medium-income” and low-energy societies of a carbon-constrained world will
                change
                the very texture of social organization and life. For greened societies not only promise a new and far more
                fulfilling array of (post-productivist and post-consumerist) livelihood options and lifestyle possibilities:
                they make it possible to finally envisage what has by now become unimaginable in industrial civilization:
                the
                prospect of freedom, security and a good life for all. Beyond “progress” lies harmony, whose contours become
                apparent as soon as we remove the blinders of social thought and organization that quietly but decisively
                conscript life into production and consumption.</p>
            <p>The shift to a new —“green”— “historical system” has been in the works for decades: conceptually, since
                Nicholas
                Geogescu-Rogen set the bases of ecological economics, and politically since the concept of “sustainable
                development” emerged in 1987. This is a <em>sine qua non</em> of the very continuity of
                civilization. And the new
                mantra
                reveals that a new consensus has been established. But it has devolved into a politically and
                programmatically
                meaningless concept.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as the IPCC’s latest report recalls, “sustainable development” remains at best a <em>“meta
                    framework”</em> to
                conceptually integrate <em>“the interlinkages and interdependence of human and natural
                    systems”</em> and the need <em>
                    “to
                    balance economic, social, and environmental aspects in development planning and processes.”
                </em> The problem is
                that
                it is notoriously subject to <em>“acute disagreements”</em> and difficulties in <em>
                    “how to measure wellbeing [and
                    define]
                    goals and means.”
                </em> It has thus spawned a rich variety of concepts, including <em>“low-carbon,”</em>
                <em>“climate-compatible”</em>
                or <em>“climate-resilient development,”</em> as well as <em>“mainstreaming,”</em> <em>“ecological
                    modernisation”</em> and <em>
                    “green
                    growth
                </em>; or
                then a <em>“green economy,”</em> <em>“doughnut economics”</em> and a
                <em>“just transition”</em> —never mind responses to the
                impossibility
                of fully decoupling GHG emissions from GDP, including <em>“degrowth,”</em> <em>“post-growth,”</em>
                <em>“post-development,”</em>
                existential
                <em>“prosperity”</em> and ultimately <em>“Good Living.”</em> In a
                word, an array of suggestive political philosophies, from
                the
                most general to the most meaningful …but little more than slogans deprived of a clear economic plan.
            </p>
            <p>Sustainability thus remains a stubborn but elusive aspiration: for we will just keep uploading GHG into the
                atmosphere unless and until it translates into a simple and clear set of policies <em>
                    commensurate with the
                    scale
                    and urgency
                </em>
                of, to begin with, mass decarbonization. This must happen quickly. And it’s not primarily green
                technologies (“new and improved” manipulation of matter) that can achieve it, but our “policy frameworks”
                …whose
                proper shape is far from obvious for lack of a clear conceptual framework, that ecological economics has not
                finished formulating. The long-brewing new discipline has radically widened the lens of modern economics,
                whose
                neoclassical method provided the organizing language of market societies. And it is now poised to specify
                the
                conditions of the <em>tripartite (ecological-distributional-market) equilibrium</em> that
                should catalyze the
                emergence
                of sustainable societies —beginning with the regulatory parameters of the rapid, drastic and harmonious
                decarbonization required to save the future.</p>
            <p>Technological progress has brought amazing benefits but is now promising societies organized and ruled by
                algorithms. But the plethora of products and services spawned by economic progress has come with material
                dispossession of the many and silent but ubiquitous existential alienation. Medical advances afford us
                wonderful
                cures but less health gains than simple nutritional, hygiene and treatment improvements …while deprivation
                of
                basics and omnipresent pollution powerfully undermine health and foster vulnerability. The only social
                progress
                humanity has clearly achieved is history’s slow, tortuous, and still unfinished march to peace. From a
                rereading
                of the world through the lens of harmony emerge the new contours not only of economics but also of politics,
                geopolitics and even of history: a new account of the past and of the future.</p>
            <p>A new image of the future is crystalizing. By now, it should be obvious that the next civilization will be
                green
                or it will not be. And the ferment that will catalyze it are new ideas that allow us to better understand
                the
                economic, political, and cultural implications of a life-sustaining habitat, beginning with climate
                stability. <a href="#;" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more">[
